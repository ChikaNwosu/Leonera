    <li>Everyone, of course! Miley Cyrus sang: We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain, never asking why. We kissed, I fell under your spell, no one could deny. Don't you ever say I just walked away, I will always want you... Mehn... with all this heartbreak and drama, sometimes, all you need is food.</li>

    <h2>We have meat lovers and vegans.</h2>
    <p>Food is meant to be enjoyed by all, both meat lovers and vegetarians alike; so, do not be shy, find that taste that rocks your world.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Implications</h2>
      <p>There is something I'd like to call feeding awareness; you get to a certain age and know what you can and can't eat. Be wary of Allergens.</p>
      </section>
      <article>
        <h2>How can you know?</h2>
        <p>In truth, some of us cannot know what we are allergic to. Not to worry, ask your parents or guardians; that might help.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h2>Strategies</h2>
          <p>It might be wise to have an epinephrine handy; an important first aid medication for anaphylaxis shock. Just saying.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <p>Not to burst the bubble of persons with a sensitive digestive makeup, but please avoid lactose if you're lactose intolerant or intolerant to any other dishes.</p>
            </article>
  <ul>
    <li>Knowing that there's food and good food.</li>
    <li>Yes! Food is sustenance, but is it adventurous too?</li>
    <li>Unleash the foodie in you by trying a new dish.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>You must have preferences, that's okay.</li>
    <li>The world changes, we change, so does food.</li>
    <li>You may not know what you like until you try some new food.</li>
    <li>Life can be hard, but tastebuds can be enticed.</li>
    <li>You can cook up a storm or look up a restaurant.</li>
